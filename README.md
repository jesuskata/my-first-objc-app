# My First iOS App with Objective-C

In this app I am going to begin with my very first app in iOS with Objective-C. Following the [course](https://www.udemy.com/curso-de-desarrollo-de-apps-para-ios-9/) from Juan Gabriel Gomila Salas at Udemy.

### 1. Making a functional button

The first task is to create a UIButton to push.

### 2. Changing the label

The second task was to push the button and change a pre-made label.

### 3. Writing a new label

The third task was to write in a text-field our name and this is going to replace the text label when we push the button.

### 4. Putting an image

The fourth task was to put an image in the screen.

### 5. A new View Controller

The fifth task was to add a new View Controller, and added to a Navigation Controller to access de app from this element.
